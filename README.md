Algorithms for computing with finite-index subgroups of (P)SL(2,Z)
----

This package implements finite-index subgroups of _(P)SL(2,Z)_ and various algorithms for working with them.
These subgroups are stored as tuples of permutations `s` and `t` which describe the action of the generator matrices
```
      ( 0 -1 )           ( 1 1 )
  S = ( 1  0 )  and  T = ( 0 1 )
```
on the right cosets.

__Usage:__ Copy this folder into your GAP package directory (usually something like `/opt/gap/gap4r8/pkg`) and load it via
```GAP
LoadPackage("ModularGroup")
```

__Usage example:__ The two main objects of this package are called `ModularSubgroup` and `ProjectiveModularSubgroup`. A `ModularSubgroup` can be constructed in two different ways:
- either by specifying the action as permutations `s` and `t` and calling the constructor as follows:
```GAP
G := ModularSubgroup(s,t);
```
- or by providing a list of generator matrices:
```GAP
G := ModularSubgroup([ ... ]);
```

The former option is recommended since the latter implicitly computes the coset graph from the generators which might be time-consuming. Moreover, no check is performed if the generated group actually has finite
index!

Projective modular subgroups can be constructed either by specifying permutations like above and executing:
```GAP
G := ProjectiveModularSubgroup(s,t);
```
Or they can be derived from subgroups in _SL(2,Z)_ by projecting them to _PSL(2,Z)_ via
```GAP
H := Projection(G);
```

Having constructed a (projective) modular subgroup, you can apply the various operations this package implements (such as testing if the given group is a congruence subgroup via `IsCongruence(G)`). For more details and a full list of the provided operations, please refer to the documentation. One explicit example is given below:

```GAP
# it is assumed that the package has been loaded as described above
gap> G := ModularSubgroup(
> (1,2,5,3)(4,8,10,9)(6,11,7,12),
> (1,4)(2,6)(3,7)(5,10)(8,12,9,11)
> );
<modular subgroup of index 12>
gap> IsCongruence(G);
true
gap> GeneratorsOfGroup(G);
[ [ [ 1, -2 ], [ 0, 1 ] ], [ [ 1, 0 ], [ 2, 1 ] ] ]
gap> GeneralizedLevel(G);
2
gap> Cusps(G);
[ infinity, 0, 1 ]
```
