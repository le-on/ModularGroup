##  URL of the archive(s) of the current package release, but *without*
##  the format extension(s), like '.tar.gz' or '-win.zip', which are given next.
##  The archive file name *must be changed* with each version of the archive
##  (and probably somehow contain the package name and version).
##  The paths of the files in the archive must begin with the name of the
##  directory containing the package (in our "example" probably:
##  example/init.g, ...    or example-3.3/init.g, ...  )
#

##  All provided formats as list of file extensions, separated by white
##  space or commas.
##  Currently recognized formats are:
##      .tar.gz    the UNIX standard
##      .tar.bz2   compressed with 'bzip2', often smaller than with gzip
##      -win.zip   zip-format for DOS/Windows, text files must have DOS
##                 style line breaks (CRLF)
##
##  In the future we may also provide .deb or .rpm formats which allow
##  a convenient installation and upgrading on Linux systems.
##
# ArchiveFormats := ".tar.gz", # the others are generated automatically
ArchiveFormats := ".tar.gz",

##  If not all of the archive formats mentioned above are provided, these
##  can be produced at the GAP side. Therefore it is necessary to know which
##  files of the package distribution are text files which should be unpacked
##  with operating system specific line breaks.
##  The package wrapping tools for the GAP distribution and web pages will
##  use a sensible list of file extensions to decide if a file
##  is a text file (being conservative, it may miss a few text files).
##  These rules may be optionally prepended by the application of rules
##  from the PackageInfo.g file. For this, there are the following three
##  mutually exclusive possibilities to specify the text files:
##
##    - specify below a component 'TextFiles' which is a list of names of the
##      text files, relative to the package root directory (e.g., "lib/bla.g"),
##      then all other files are taken as binary files.
##    - specify below a component 'BinaryFiles' as list of names, then all other
##      files are taken as text files.
##    - specify below a component 'TextBinaryFilesPatterns' as a list of names
##      and/or wildcards, prepended by 'T' for text files and by 'B' for binary
##      files.
##
##  (Remark: Just providing a .tar.gz file will often result in useful
##  archives)
##
##  These entries are *optional*.
#TextFiles := ["init.g", ......],
#BinaryFiles := ["doc/manual.dvi", ......],
#TextBinaryFilesPatterns := [ "TGPLv3", "Texamples/*", "B*.in", ......],


##  Information about authors and maintainers is contained in the `Persons'
##  field which is a list of records, one record for each person; each
##  person's record should be as per the following example:
##
##     rec(
##     # these are compulsory, the strings can be encoded in UTF-8 or latin1,
##     # so using German umlauts or other special characters is ok:
##     LastName := "Müller",
##     FirstNames := "Fritz Eduard",
##
##     # At least one of the following two entries must be given and set
##     # to 'true' (an entry can be left out if value is not 'true'):
##     IsAuthor := true;
##     IsMaintainer := true;
##
##     # At least one of the following three entries must be given
##     # for each maintainer of the package:
##     # - preferably email address and WWW homepage
##     # - postal address not needed if email or WWW address available
##     # - if no contact known, specify postal address as "no address known"
##     Email := "Mueller@no.org",
##     # complete URL, starting with protocol
##     WWWHome := "http://www.no.org/~Mueller",
##     # separate lines by '\n' (*optional*)
##     PostalAddress := "Dr. F. Müller\nNo Org Institute\nNo Place 13\n\
##     12345 Notown\nNocountry"
##
##     # If you want, add one or both of the following entries (*optional*)
##     Place := "Notown",

##     )
##

##  Status information. Currently the following cases are recognized:
##    "accepted"      for successfully refereed packages
##    "submitted"     for packages submitted for the refereeing
##    "deposited"     for packages for which the GAP developers agreed
##                    to distribute them with the core GAP system
##    "dev"           for development versions of packages
##    "other"         for all other packages
##
# Status := "accepted",
Status := "dev",

##  You must provide the next two entries if and only if the status is
##  "accepted" because is was successfully refereed:
# format: 'name (place)'
# CommunicatedBy := "Mike Atkinson (St. Andrews)",
#CommunicatedBy := "",
# format: mm/yyyy
# AcceptDate := "08/1999",
#AcceptDate := "",

##  For a central overview of all packages and a collection of all package
##  archives it is necessary to have two files accessible which should be
##  contained in each package:
##     - A README file, containing a short abstract about the package
##       content and installation instructions.
##     - The PackageInfo.g file you are currently reading or editing!
##  You must specify URLs for these two files, these allow to automate
##  the updating of package information on the GAP Website, and inclusion
##  and updating of the package in the GAP distribution.
#
README_URL :=
  Concatenation( ~.PackageWWWHome, "/README.md" ),
PackageInfoURL :=
  Concatenation( ~.PackageWWWHome, "/PackageInfo.g" ),

##  Here you  must provide a short abstract explaining the package content
##  in HTML format (used on the package overview Web page) and an URL
##  for a Webpage with more detailed information about the package
##  (not more than a few lines, less is ok):
##  Please, use '<span class="pkgname">GAP</span>' and
##  '<span class="pkgname">MyPKG</span>' for specifing package names.
##
# AbstractHTML := "This package provides  a collection of functions for \
# computing the Smith normal form of integer matrices and some related \
# utilities.",

  finit-index subgroups of (P)SL(2,Z).",

##  Here is the information on the help books of the package, used for
##  loading into GAP's online help and maybe for an online copy of the
##  documentation on the GAP website.
##
##  For the online help the following is needed:
##       - the name of the book (.BookName)
##       - a long title, shown by ?books (.LongTitle, optional)
##       - the path to the manual.six file for this book (.SixFile)
##
##  For an online version on a Web page further entries are needed,
##  if possible, provide an HTML- and a PDF-version:
##      - if there is an HTML-version the path to the start file,
##        relative to the package home directory (.HTMLStart)
##      - if there is a PDF-version the path to the .pdf-file,
##        relative to the package home directory (.PDFFile)
##      - give the paths to the files inside your package directory
##        which are needed for the online manual (as a list
##        .ArchiveURLSubset of names of directories and/or files which
##        should be copied from your package archive, given in .ArchiveURL
##        above (in most cases, ["doc"] or ["doc","htm"] suffices).
##
##  For links to other GAP or package manuals you can assume a relative
##  position of the files as in a standard GAP installation.
##
# in case of several help books give a list of such records here:
PackageDoc := rec(
  # use same as in GAP
  BookName  := "ModularGroup",
  # format/extension can be one of .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, -win.zip, .zip.
  ArchiveURLSubset := ["doc"],
  HTMLStart := "doc/chap0.html",
  PDFFile   := "doc/manual.pdf",
  # the path to the .six file used by GAP's help system
  SixFile   := "doc/manual.six",
  # a longer title of the book, this together with the book name should
  # fit on a single text line (appears with the '?books' command in GAP)
  # LongTitle := "Elementary Divisors of Integer Matrices",
  LongTitle := ~.Subtitle,

##  the package need other packages to be available?
